# GarbledText_Gen
A simple script that generates garbled text. just so your phrase can look more...cursed.

# How to use

You can either run this on VSCode in the terminal, or you can run directly on IDLE Python.
I do not recomend running this on the CMD because it closes imediatly because it cannot handle special characters.

# Modifications.

You can edit the file by including more ASCII characters.
